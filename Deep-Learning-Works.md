1. The training and validation datasets are defined, and the training features are fed into the input layer.
2. The neurons in each layer of the network apply their weights (which are initially assigned randomly) and feed the data through the network.
3. The output layer produces a vector containing the calculated values for ŷ. For example, an output for a penguin class prediction might be [0.3. 0.1. 0.6].
4. A loss function is used to compare the predicted ŷ values to the known y values and aggregate the difference (which is known as the loss). For example, if the known class for the case that returned the output in the previous step is Chinstrap, then the y value should be [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]. The absolute difference between this and the ŷ vector is [0.3, 0.1, 0.4]. In reality, the loss function calculates the aggregate variance for multiple cases and summarizes it as a single loss value.
5. Since the entire network is essentially one large nested function, an optimization function can use differential calculus to evaluate the influence of each weight in the network on the loss, and determine how they could be adjusted (up or down) to reduce the amount of overall loss. The specific optimization technique can vary, but usually involves a gradient descent approach in which each weight is increased or decreased to minimize the loss.
6. The changes to the weights are backpropagated to the layers in the network, replacing the previously used values.
7. The process is repeated over multiple iterations (known as epochs) until the loss is minimized and the model predicts acceptably accurately.
