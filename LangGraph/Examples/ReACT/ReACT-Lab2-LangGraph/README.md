# Lesson 2. Calculate Dogs' Total Weight using LangGraph

This lab is number 2 in the series of labs for the course "Introduction to DeepLearning LangGraph".  
This is the implementation of the same task I solved in the previous lab about dogs, but ising LangGraph.  
It's working using Conda3 environment, I named mine "deeplearning-ai".  
That's why requirements.txt is not used and empty.
