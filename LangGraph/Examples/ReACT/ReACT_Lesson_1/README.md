# Lesson 1. Calculate Dogs' Total Weight using "Pre-Coded Loop" (loop + OpenAI calls)

This lab is number 1 in the series of labs for the course "Introduction to DeepLearning LangGraph".  
It's working using Conda3 environment, I named mine "deeplearning-ai".  
That's why requirements.txt is not used and empty.
