## Advanced Retrieval & Re-ranking
### Re-ranking Algorithms  
a. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) - RRF_score = Î£(1/(k + rank_i))  
b. Cross-encoder vs Bi-encoder - Accuracy vs speed trade-offs  
c. Neural Re-rankers - BERT/T5-based cross-attention models  
d. Learning to Rank (LTR) - ML-based ranking optimization  
e. Score Normalization Techniques - Min-max, z-score, sigmoid  

### Advanced Retrieval Concepts
a. Semantic Similarity Scoring - Cosine similarity between embeddings  
b. Context Preservation - Chunk coherence maintenance  
c. Window Size Optimization - Re-ranking candidate selection (100-1000)
