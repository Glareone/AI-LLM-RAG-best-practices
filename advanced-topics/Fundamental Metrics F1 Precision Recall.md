## Fundamental Metrics of Response.

1️⃣ Precision: "Of what I found, how much was actually good?"  
2️⃣ Recall: "Of all the good stuff that exists, how much did I find?"  
3️⃣ F1: "What's the balanced score between precision and recall?"

### Basic metrics understanding

|              |             |             |             |
|  ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|              |             |             |   ACTUAL    |
|  PREDICTED   | Positive    | TP          |   FP        |
|              | Negative    | FN          |   TN        |

- TP (True Positives): Correctly identified positive cases
- FP (False Positives): Incorrectly identified as positive (Type I Error)
- FN (False Negatives): Missed positive cases (Type II Error)
- TN (True Negatives): Correctly identified negative cases

**Precision Formula:**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
         = True Positives Found / Total Positives
         = "Of what I predicted as positive, how much was actually positive?"
```
**Recall Formula:**
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
       = True Positives / Total Actual Positives  
       = "Of all actual positives, how many did I find?"
```
**F1 Score Formula:**
```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   = 2PR / (P + R)
   = Harmonic Mean of Precision and Recall
```

### Q&A Section

**Q1: Are P/R/F1 everywhere? Are they universal?**   
A1: Yes, they are absolutely universal! These three metrics appear in:  

1️⃣ Google Search (how good are search results?)  
2️⃣ Medical diagnosis (cancer detection accuracy)  
3️⃣ Email spam filtering (catch spam without blocking good emails)  
4️⃣ Netflix recommendations (suggest movies you'll actually like)  
5️⃣ AI model evaluation (assess language model performance)  

**Q2: What the difference between precision and Recall? Their formulas look similar.**  
A2: Both are indeed "success rate" calculations, but they're measuring success against different denominators:  
- Precision: Correct Predictions / Total Predictions Made. Precision: `"Of My Predictions, How Many Were Right?"`  
- Recall: Correct Detections / Total Things That Actually Exist. `"Of All Real Cases, How Many Did I Find?"`

#### Examples
1️⃣ Precision
```
Example: Email Spam Detection
- You flagged 100 emails as spam
- 85 were actually spam, 15 were legitimate emails

Precision = 85 / (85 TP + 15 FP) = 85/100 = 0.85 (85%)

Interpretation: "When I flag something as spam, I'm right 85% of the time"
```
2️⃣ Recall
```
Example: Security Threat Detection  
- There were 120 actual threats in the system
- Your system detected 90 of them, missed 30

Recall = 90 / (90 TP + 30 FN) = 90/120 = 0.75 (75%)

Interpretation: "I caught 75% of all real threats"
```

3️⃣ F1: Ariphmetic Mean
```
(Precision + Recall) / 2
```
3️⃣ F1: Harmonic Mean
- Example 1: Balanced Performance
```

Precision = 0.8, Recall = 0.8
Arithmetic Mean = (0.8 + 0.8) / 2 = 0.8
Harmonic Mean (F1) = 2 × (0.8 × 0.8) / (0.8 + 0.8) = 1.28/1.6 = 0.8
Same result ✅
```
- Example 2: Unbalanced Performance  
```

Precision = 0.9, Recall = 0.1
Arithmetic Mean = (0.9 + 0.1) / 2 = 0.5
Harmonic Mean (F1) = 2 × (0.9 × 0.1) / (0.9 + 0.1) = 0.18/1.0 = 0.18
F1 punishes the low recall! ✅
```

### EXAMPLE 2.
Medical Cancer Screening  
Scenario: Testing 1000 patients for cancer  

- 100 patients actually have cancer
- Your test flags 120 patients as having cancer
- Of those 120 flagged, 80 actually have cancer
  
**Step 1: Build the Confusion Matrix**  
                    ACTUAL
                 Cancer  No Cancer
PREDICTED Cancer   80      40      (TP=80, FP=40)
       No Cancer   20     860      (FN=20, TN=860)
  
**Step 2: Calculate Each Metric**  
1️⃣ Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 80 / (80 + 40) = 80/120 = 0.667 (66.7%)  
"Of patients I flagged as having cancer, 66.7% actually have it"  

2️⃣ Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 80 / (80 + 20) = 80/100 = 0.80 (80%)  
"I detected 80% of all actual cancer cases"  

3️⃣ F1 = 2 × (0.667 × 0.80) / (0.667 + 0.80) = 2 × 0.534 / 1.467 = 0.727 (72.7%)  
"My balanced diagnostic performance is 72.7%"

#### F1/P/R for BERTScore
1️⃣ F1 Score - Your primary metric (balanced view)  
- 0.85: Excellent quality  
- 0.70-0.84: Good quality  
- < 0.70: Needs improvement
  
2️⃣ Precision - Focus when false positives are expensive  
- "Only flag as good if you're confident"  
- Medical diagnosis, fraud detection
  
3️⃣ Recall - Focus when missing things is expensive  
- "Better safe than sorry"  
- Security monitoring, medical screening
