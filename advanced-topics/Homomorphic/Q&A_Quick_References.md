### Q&A. Quick References

```
START: Do you need to process sensitive data?  
│  
├─ NO → Use standard encryption or no encryption  
│  
└─ YES → Can you trust the processing environment?   
    │  
    ├─ YES → Consider simpler alternatives (see below)  
    │  
    └─ NO → Is data utility more important than performance?  
        │  
        ├─ NO → Consider Differential Privacy or Federated Learning  
        │  
        └─ YES → Use Homomorphic Encryption
```

### Use Cases and Whether or Not
| Situation | Recommended Approach | Reason |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Medical records in cloud | ✅ Homomorphic Encryption | HIPAA compliance, untrusted cloud | 
| Internal company analytics | Traditional Encryption | Trusted environment | 
| Public research data | No encryption needed | Already public | 
| Customer reviews analysis | Differential Privacy | Aggregate insights only | 
| Multi-party ML training | Federated Learning | Data stays distributed | 
| Financial fraud detection | ✅ HE or Secure MPC | Regulatory requirements | 
| Personal health tracking | ✅ HE Homomorphic Encryption | Individual-level privacy | 
| Marketing analytics | Differential Privacy | Aggregate trends sufficient |

### How to Start. Choosing the Right HE Library
1️⃣ TenSEAL - For Beginners  
✅ Python-friendly  
✅ Good documentation   
✅ Tensor operations  
⚠️ Less control over parameters  

2️⃣ Microsoft SEAL - For Production & Industry standard  
✅ Well-tested  
✅ High performance  
✅ Comprehensive features  
⚠️ C++ primary (Python wrapper available)  

3️⃣ Concrete-ML - Purpose-built. For ML Integration  
✅ Specifically for ML  
✅ Scikit-learn compatible  
✅ Good documentation  
⚠️ Limited to supported models
