### BLEURT - BERT-based learned evaluation metric  

BLEURT is the "trained cousin" of BERTScore - it takes BERT's semantic understanding and trains it specifically on human evaluation data to predict quality scores.  
The New Revolutionary Approach  
BERTScore: Uses pre-trained BERT embeddings directly  
BLEURT: Fine-tunes BERT on human quality ratings  

**Training Process:**
1. Start with pre-trained BERT
2. Add human evaluation datasets (WMT, etc.)
3. Train to predict human quality scores
4. Result: Better correlation with human judgment

#### How BLEURT Works
```python
# Conceptual BLEURT process
def bleurt_score(candidate, reference):
    # Step 1: Encode both texts with fine-tuned BERT
    encoded = bleurt_model.encode(candidate, reference)
    
    # Step 2: Pass through learned scoring head
    quality_score = scoring_head(encoded)
    
    # Step 3: Return single quality score (0-1)
    return quality_score  # e.g., 0.73
```
#### BLEURT vs BERTScore
Same Example:
Reference: "The scientist discovered a new species"  
Candidate: "A researcher found a previously unknown organism"  

BERTScore: 
- Calculates semantic similarity using cosine similarity
- Returns: Precision=0.85, Recall=0.82, F1=0.83

BLEURT:
- Uses human-trained model to predict quality
- Returns: Single score=0.89 (closer to human judgment)

#### BLEURT. When to Use
Good At:  
‚úÖ General text quality evaluation - Best overall correlation with humans  
‚úÖ When you have computational resources - Slower than traditional metrics  
‚úÖ Academic benchmarking - Gold standard for research  
‚úÖ High-stakes evaluation - When accuracy is more important than speed  
Limitations:  
üî¥ Computationally expensive - Requires GPU for reasonable speed  
üî¥ Black box nature - Less interpretable than P/R/F1 breakdowns  
üî¥ Model dependency - Requires specific BLEURT model weights
