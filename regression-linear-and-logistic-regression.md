## Difference between Linear and Logistic
Logistic fits better in scenarios when you need to answer yes or no.

## Multi-class Logistic Regression
[Microsoft learn doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/component-reference/multiclass-logistic-regression?view=azureml-api-2#about-multiclass-logistic-regression)  
Logistic regression is a well-known method in statistics that is used to predict the probability of an outcome, and is popular for classification tasks. The algorithm predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic function.
In multiclass logistic regression, the classifier can be used to predict multiple outcomes.
